# Sub-Zero (SubCommands)

We have touching on the basics of creating a command, but what if we want to create a command that has sub-commands? For example, we want to create a command that has a `create` and `delete` sub-command. This is where sub-commands come in.

## Creating a Sub-Command

To create a sub-command, we need to create a new class that extends `SubCommand` and implement the `execute` method. We then need to add the sub-command to the parent command.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="create.ts" label="Create.ts" default>
    ```ts showLineNumbers
import { Command, SubCommand, CommandContext } from 'seyfert';
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="delete.ts" label="delete">
    ```ts showLineNumbers
import { Command, SubCommand, CommandContext } from 'seyfert';
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
