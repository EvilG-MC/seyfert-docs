# Sub-Zero (SubCommands)

We have touching on the basics of creating a command, but what if we want to create a command that has sub-commands? For example, we want to create a command that has a `create` and `delete` sub-command. This is where sub-commands come in.

## Creating a Sub-Command

To create a sub-command, we need to create a new class that extends `SubCommand` and implement the `execute` method. We then need to add the sub-command to the parent command.

It's suppose you have the following directory structure:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src">
        <FileTree.Folder name="commands">
            <FileTree.Folder name="account">
              <FileTree.File name="create.command.ts" />
              <FileTree.File name="delete.command.ts" />
              <FileTree.File name="parent.ts" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="seyfert.config.js" />
    <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
    <FileTree.File name="tsconfig.json" />
</FileTree>

```ts title="create.command.ts" showLineNumbers
import { Declare, SubCommand, CommandContext } from 'seyfert';

@Declare({
  name: 'create',
  description: 'create a new something',
})
export class AddCommand extends SubCommand {
  public async execute(ctx: CommandContext) {

    // some logic there

    ctx.reply({
      content: 'create command executed',
    });
  }
}
```

```ts title="delete.command.ts" showLineNumbers
import { Declare, SubCommand, CommandContext } from 'seyfert';

@Declare({
  name: 'delete',
  description: 'delete something',
})
export class DeleteCommand extends SubCommand {
  public async execute(ctx: CommandContext) {

    // some logic here

    ctx.reply({
      content: 'delete command executed',
    });
  }
}
```

```ts title="parent.ts" showLineNumbers
import { Declare, Command, Options, CommandContext } from 'seyfert';
import { AddCommand } from './create.command';
import { DeleteCommand } from './delete.command';

@Declare({
  name: 'account',
  description: 'account command',
})
@Options([
  AddCommand,
  DeleteCommand,
])
export default class AccountCommand extends Command { }
```

In the example above, we have created a `create` and `delete` sub-command. We then added the sub-commands to the parent command using the `@Options` decorator.

:::note
Notice that basically we treat the sub-command as an option of the parent command. (actually this is how discord treats sub-commands as well)
