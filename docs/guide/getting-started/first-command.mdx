# Creating your first command

In Seyfert, commands are the main structure of any discord bot project, although Discord support for them is quite poor, utilities have been developed for creating them.

Let's start by declaring the first command of the application

```ts title="src/commands/ping.ts" showLineNumbers
import { Declare, Command, type CommandContext } from 'seyfert';

@Declare({
    name: 'ping',
    description: 'Show the ping with discord'
})
export default class PingCommand extends Command {

    async run(ctx: CommandContext) {
        const ping = ctx.client.gateway.latency; //average latency between shards

        await ctx.write({
            content: `The ping is \`${ping}\``
        });
    }

}
```

To test if your command works correctly, you must first publish it on Discord after making minor changes to your main file:

```ts {5-8} title="src/index.ts" showLineNumbers
import { Client } from 'seyfert';

const client = new Client();

client.start().then(() => client.uploadCommands());
```

Pretty simple, right? But sometimes commands are not just about receiving a request and responding to it, you also have to think about what the user wants, that's where the `options` come in, let's make the response of this command something private.

## Using options

```ts {4-5,9-13,19,23-24} title="src/commands/ping.ts" showLineNumbers
import {
  Command,
  Declare,
  Options,
  createBooleanOption,
  type CommandContext
} from 'seyfert';

const options = {
    hide: createBooleanOption({
        description: "Hide command output",
    }),
}

@Declare({
    name: 'ping',
    description: 'Show the ping with discord'
})
@Options(options)
export default class PingCommand extends Command {

    async run(ctx: CommandContext<typeof options>) {
        const hide = ctx.options.hide ?? false;
        const flags = +hide && MessageFlags.Ephemeral;

        const ping = ctx.client.gateway.latency; //average latency between shards

        await ctx.write({
                content: `The ping is \`${ping}\``
                flags,
            });
        }

}
```
