# Understanding `declare module`

:::mpte

This technique is called module augmentation, you can learn how it's about in [typescript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation)

Due to the versatility of seyfert, it can be confusing to understand exactly how to include content in the project, so seyfert includes different interfaces for the developer to use when defining their own rules.

## Clients

Seyfert includes several types of client to create the instance of a bot, this can create confusion when calling the client anywhere in your code, so you can specify to typescript which one you are using:
```ts
declare module 'seyfert' {
    interface UsingClient extends ParseClient<Client<true>> { }
    // interface UsingClient extends ParseClient<WorkerClient<true>> { }
    // interface UsingClient extends ParseClient<HttpClient> { }
} 
```

In order for you to be able to use your middleware everywhere, it is again necessary to tell typescript what they are and how they are made up. Export all middlewares in your code and pass it to seyfert:
```ts
import type * as allMiddlewares from './middlewares'

declare module 'seyfert' {
    interface RegisteredMiddlewares extends ParseMiddlewares<typeof allMiddlewares> { }
}
```
This is the same as above, but applies to global middlewares, those that are executed in every command even without specifying it.

```ts
import type * as allMiddlewares from './middlewares/globals'

declare module 'seyfert' {
    interface GlobalMetadata extends ParseMiddlewares<typeof globalMiddlewares> { }
} 
```

In the Seyfert language system, the default language is prioritized, including the typing provided by typescript.

:::info
It is highly recommended to use `.ts`, `.js` files for your translations, so you can include functions inside them and autocomplete!
:::

:::warning
If you use json for this (not recommended), you must add `../` to the path in your `seyfert.config.js` because typescript ignores jsons that are not imported manually.

```ts
import type * as defaultLang from './langs/en'

declare module 'seyfert' {
    interface DefaultLocale extends ParseLocales<typeof defaultLang> { }   
} 
```
