# Listening discord events

:::info

This part is only for gateway applications, so if you bot is a http application-only you can skip this.

First of all you must tell seyfert where your events will be by updating your config file.

```ts {11} title="seyfert.config.js" showLineNumbers
// @ts-check
const { config } = require('seyfert');

module.exports = config.bot({
    token: process.env.BOT_TOKEN,
    intents: ["Guilds"],
    locations: {
        base: "src",
        output: "dist",
        commands: "commands",
        events: "events"
    }
});
```

Then you can create a listener by exporting `createEvent` from a file inside the `events` folder, let's see an example:

```ts title="src/events/botReady.ts" showLineNumbers
import { createEvent } from "seyfert";

export default createEvent({
    data: { once: true, name: "botReady" },
    async run(user, client, shard) {
        client.logger.info(`${user.username} is ready on shard #${shard}`);
    }
})
```

The `createEvent` function accepts two generic types, the first one is "nose, socram", the second one is the name of the event.

Let's check another example with `messageCreate` event:

```ts title="src/events/messageCreate.ts" showLineNumbers
import { createEvent } from "seyfert";

export default createEvent({
    data: { name: "messageCreate" },
    async run(message, client) {
        if (!message.author || message.author.bot) return;

        if (message.content === "ping") {
            await message.write({
                content: "pong",
            });
        }
    }
})
```

And that's it, you can create as many events as you want. You can check the list of events [here](SOONTM).
